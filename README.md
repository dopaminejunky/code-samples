# code-samples
Code samples I've written; mostly homework assignments and academic projects. 

--PYTHON--

ShoppingList: Basic shopping list. Accepts user input, enforces invariants

PrimeFactors: Self explanatory. Accepts user input, formats output properly, factoring algorithm

TicTacToe: Tic Tac Toe display. Working with GUI3

--JAVA--

WordProcessor: More of a text formatter. Linked data structure, object serialization, improperly implemented Singleton pattern (TODO), write output to basic HTML

WordCount: Reads a text file and outputs a list of words and number of occurances. Reading data from a file, working with maps and iterators.

SieveOfEratosthenes: Another factoring program. Working with user input, factoring algorithms, interfaces

HashQueueCallCenterSim: Imitate a call center where support staff take calls from customers. Timers, reading from CSV files, hashqueue implementation

BSTusingCSV: Parse data about wearable devices: Binary search tree, sorting via various properties, allow for duplicate entries

--C++--

StringCompression: Given a string with repeated characters, output a shorter string using numbers to represent repeats. Operator overloading, working with vectors, iterators, and pointers

SetWithCounter: A templated Set that can track and print ranked values. Templated classes and data types, lambda expression, using the STL

ReversePrint: Given input, print in the reverse order: Implemented doubly linked data structure, iterative and recursive reverse print solutions, deep copy constructor.

BSTtemplate: A generic binary search tree with preorder, inorder, and postorder outputs. Added breadth first search. Recursion, templates, pointers, implementing in headers
